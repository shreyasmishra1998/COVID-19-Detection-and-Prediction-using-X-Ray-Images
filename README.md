# COVID-19-Detection-and-Prediction-using-X-Ray-Images
In this project, I have used the IEEE open source dataset for positive COVID images and used PNEUMONIA dataset from Kaggle for COVID negative images. Dataset was classified into training, testing and validation datasets originally, and while the model was fit on the training and validation datasets, it was tested on the testing dataset where we obtained our confusion matrix. As can be seen from the confusion matrix there are very little false positives or negatives that have been found. The model also correctly predicted the result from images obtained from other sources. Here only the PA type images have been used.
